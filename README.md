Use Case model is used to specify the functionality of a system from the
point of view of the business users. Each Use Cases describes a logical task that may be
performed by the system. The Use Case description describes the interaction between
the system and the outside world. That interaction may be an online transaction where the
Actor is a human user.

We use UML as an effective tool to create a specification for a system. A development
process that is aimed at new build can be adapted quite straightforwardly for enhancing
existing systems or evaluating and implementing packages.
